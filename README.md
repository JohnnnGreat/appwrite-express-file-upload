# File Upload API with Appwrite using Node.js and Express

This project is a RESTful API built with Node.js and Express that allows you to upload Files to an
Appwrite storage bucket. Once uploaded, the API returns a URL that you can use to access the File.
It is designed to be a simple and scalable way to handle file uploads in web applications.

## Features

-  File Upload: Handles File uploads through an HTTP POST request
-  Appwrite Integration: Uses Appwrite's Storage API to manage file storage
-  Environment Configuration: Environment variables are used for storing sensitive data
-  CORS Support: Configured to handle cross-origin requests

## Prerequisites

To run this project, you'll need:

-  Node.js (v14 or higher)
-  An Appwrite instance or access to an existing Appwrite server
-  An Appwrite Project with a configured Bucket for storing files

## Project Setup

### 1. Clone the Repository

First, clone the project repository and navigate into the project directory:

```bash
git clone <repository-url>
cd <project-directory>
```

### 2. Install Dependencies

Install the necessary dependencies using npm or yarn:

```bash

npm install
# or
yarn install
```

### 3. Configure Environment Variables

Create a .env file in the root directory of your project based on the provided .env.example file:

```bash
# .env
PORT=9000
APPWRITE_ENDPOINT=https://your-appwrite-server.com/v1
APPWRITE_PROJECT_ID=your_project_id
APPWRITE_API_KEY=your_appwrite_api_key
APPWRITE_BUCKET_ID=your_appwrite_bucket_id
Fill in the values:

APPWRITE_ENDPOINT: URL of your Appwrite server
APPWRITE_PROJECT_ID: ID of your Appwrite project
APPWRITE_API_KEY: API key for accessing your Appwrite instance
APPWRITE_BUCKET_ID: ID of the bucket where Files will be stored
```

### 4. Start the Server

To start the server, use the following command:

```bash

Copy
npm start
# or
yarn start
```

The server will be available at http://localhost:9000 by default.

### API Endpoints

POST /upload Uploads an File file to the Appwrite bucket and returns the URL of the uploaded File.

URL: /upload Method: POST Content-Type: multipart/form-data Body Parameters: File (required): The
File file to be uploaded Response: 200 OK: JSON object with the File URL if the upload is successful
400 Bad Request: If no file is uploaded 500 Internal Server Error: If there's an error during the
upload Example Usage Upload an File using curl:

```bash

curl -X POST http://localhost:9000/upload \
  -F "File=@/path/to/your/File.jpg"
  -F "File=@/path/to/your/File.pdf"
  -F "File=@/path/to/your/File.docx"
  -F "File=@/path/to/your/File.txt"

```

Example Response

```bash

{
  "success": true,
  "FileUrl": "https://your-appwrite-server.com/v1/storage/buckets/your_bucket_id/files/unique_file_id/view?project=your_project_id"
}
```

└── uploads/          # Temporary folder for uploaded files

### Dependencies
The project uses the following Node.js packages:

Express: A fast, unopinionated web framework for Node.js
Multer: Middleware for handling multipart/form-data, used for file uploads
node-appwrite: Appwrite's official Node.js SDK for interacting with the Appwrite API
dotenv: Loads environment variables from a .env file
cors: Middleware for enabling Cross-Origin Resource Sharing
To install all dependencies, run:

```bash

Copy
npm install express multer node-appwrite dotenv cors
# or
yarn add express multer node-appwrite dotenv cors
````

### Security Considerations

Store sensitive data like API keys and project IDs in the .env file Do not commit the .env file to
version control by ensuring it's listed in .gitignore Implement additional security measures such as
authentication to restrict access to the API if needed Next Steps Possible enhancements:

Multi-file Uploads: Modify the API to support uploading multiple files simultaneously File Deletion:
Add endpoints to handle file deletion from the Appwrite bucket User Authentication: Secure the API
with authentication and authorization mechanisms Error Handling: Improve error handling for better
debugging and client communication Feel free to contribute or modify the project for your specific
use cases!

### 🏗️ Built With

Node.js & Express - For the API server Appwrite - For File storage and management Multer - Handling
file uploads like a boss CORS - Because we play nice with other domains

### 📝 Notes

Currently supports single File uploads Maximum file size is 5MB (configurable in code)

Accepts common File formats (jpg, png, gif, docs, pdf etc)

### 🚧 Roadmap

Add support for multiple file uploads Implement file type validation Add File compression options
Create delete endpoint Add user authentication
